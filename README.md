### ofxControl

ofxControl is an addon for openFrameworks which manages parameters (variables). It features:

 * GUI
 * Osc management (send/receive)
 * Presets
 * Sequencer
 * Midi sequencer
 * Save TouchOSC layouts

It has many features but is currently a work in progress, and overlaps a great deal with ofxGui and ofParameter, as well as borrowing some features from other addons like ofxUI. 	

The examples demonstrate most of the key features.
